Translon is an extension that provides real-time translation on VSCode by opening the DeepL translator website in a browser and automatically typing in it.

Simply open a plain text or Markdown file and click the Translate button on the toolbar.

There is no need to configure API settings.

## Features

- Real-time translation of plain text and Markdown

## Requires

- Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome must be installed

> If you are using Windows, you already have Microsoft Edge installed and do not need to do anything.<br/>**If you are using Mac or Linux, you need to have either browser installed.**

## Usage

1. Open any plain text or Markdown file.
2. Click the `æ–‡/A` button on the top bar.<br/>Your browser will automatically launch and open the DeepL website.
3. Enter a sentence and it will be translated in real time.
4. For other DeepL features, use the browser window directly.

## Settings

### Browser Distribution Channel

You can select the browser to open the translator website from Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. (Selected one must be installed on your PC.)

The default value is Microsoft Edge.

### Use Headless Browser

You can select whether to use a headless browser instead of a GUI browser.

When using a headless browser, the browser window will not be displayed, but complex operations will not be possible.
